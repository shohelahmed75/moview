# Moview 🎬

Moview is a modern React web application that lets you search for movies, view their details, and keep track of the movies you've watched. It uses the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch movie data and provides a clean, interactive UI with features like star ratings and persistent watched lists.

## Features

- **Search Movies:** Type at least 3 characters to search for movies by title.
- **Movie Details:** Click on a movie to view detailed information, including plot, actors, director, genre, and IMDb rating.
- **Star Rating:** Rate movies using a customizable star rating component.
- **Watched List:** Add movies to your watched list with your own rating and see a summary of your watched stats.
- **Persistent Storage:** Your watched list is saved in your browser's local storage.
- **Responsive UI:** Clean, modern design with responsive layout.
